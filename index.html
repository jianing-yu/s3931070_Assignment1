    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <h3>1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
    <p>The first thing I focus on is the overall site tone, the canvas that takes up the largest proportion and the toolbar on the left and top of the screen.</p>
    <h3>2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
    <p>In the center of the screen is a canvas that can be drawn with the mouse track.
        The "file" in the upper left corner can create a new canvas and import and export images; "image" can adjust the canvas parameters, including modifying the canvas size and flipping the canvas.
        The toolbar on the left can adjust the thickness of the brush, undo operations, move the canvas, set and view website information.
        Above the canvas, it allows adjust the shape and color of the brush, change the brush to eraser and fill.</p>
    <h3>3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
    <p>I spend most of my time trying to paint on the canvas using brushes of different colors and shapes.</p>
    <h3>4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
    <p>Use the mouse to draw patterns on the canvas.</p>
    <h3>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
    <p>The shape, material and color of the overall website fonts and brushes are very harmonious, and the interaction freedom is very high.</p>
    <h3>6) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h3>
    <p>Conveys the overall simple experience of retro pixel screen.</p>
    <h3>7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
    <p>After drawing four stick figures of different styles in six to seven minutes, I gradually felt the lack of new ideas. I was limited by the shape and color of the brush, and the creativity I could think of in a short time was exhausted. When drawing the fourth painting, I have been able to use the tools on the canvas proficiently.</p>
    <h3>8) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
    <p>Over time, in order to avoid duplication, the website can add 20% new content every ten minutes or so to continuously unlock a complete interactive experience.</p>

    <h2>Week 3</h2>
    <h3>9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
    <p>This website refers to the form of digital painting software, such as procreate, which uses a mouse or a paintbrush to draw on an electronic screen.</p>
    <h3>10) What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h3>
    <p>The icon and layout of the website are easy to recognize after reference, which can be imagined as a mouse-drawn version of procreate.</p>
    <h3>11) What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h3>
    <p>The basic functions required for painting can be found in the toolbar, so I can get started more quickly. But it can only do some entry-level operations, and it is a simple version of the painting tool.</p>
    <h3>12) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h3>
    <p>The brushes are only available in colors such as black, white and grey. If I can use any color, I can use the website to create more complex images.</p>
    <h3>13) What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h3>
    <p>The overall texture of the website is very uniform, and the brushes with retro materials can draw very story-telling patterns.</p>
